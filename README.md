# Codetober 2025

ðŸŽƒ My 25's Codetober Challenge! ðŸš€ Building a new coding project every day this October. ðŸ“… Each day's solution lives on a separate branch named for that day (e.g., day-01, day-02, etc.). 31 days, 31 projects!

## Day 01: [Type-Ahead Search](https://github.com/marinellibr/codetober-25/tree/day-01/type-ahead-search)

For the first day of Codetober, I built a highly efficient type-ahead search component that queries the Wikipedia API. The primary focus was on using a sophisticated RxJS pipe to manage the stream of user input, ensuring optimal performance and a smooth user experience.

**Key concepts demonstrated:**

- **`debounceTime`**: Waits for the user to pause typing before sending a request.
- **`distinctUntilChanged`**: Avoids sending duplicate requests for the same search term.
- **`switchMap`**: Cancels previous pending API requests to prevent race conditions and ensure only the latest results are displayed.
- **`async` pipe**: For clean, declarative subscription management in the template.

### A Note on the Development Process

Given the one-day time constraint for each challenge, the initial focus is purely on **developing the core functionality**.

After the Codetober challenge is complete, I will perform a refinement pass on every project. This second phase will include implementing comprehensive **unit tests** and adding **in-depth code comments** to explain my architectural choices and thought process.
